**CALCULATION OF NUMBER OF POINTS WITHIN A TRIANGLE**

The objective of this exercise is to find the number of points of each type that are inside a triangle.
Each point is actually a bus stop in a city in Europe. The "X" coordinate is "demand average score" and the 
"y" coordinate is "offer average score". This two dimensions were calculated previously for each stop from 
different indicators. Values range from 1 to 5. Each stop can be of 3 types: rural, city and town. And this
does not depend on the two variables X and Y. And for a question of the project, it was asked to calculate 
all the points of city, rural and town that had an offer average score less than 3, and that at the same time 
were in the upper part of the line y = x.
